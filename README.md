# DesktopOrganizer
The goal of this project is to create a python tool that will create numerous directores on the users desktop, find any files on the desktop, and organize them properly. Will work on Windows/Mac/Linux

So far, no libraries not already bundled with python is used. So, just run
```
python main.py
```
